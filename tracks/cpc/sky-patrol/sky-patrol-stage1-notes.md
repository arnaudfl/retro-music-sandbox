![Sky Patrol – Stage 1](./art/sky-patrol-stage1.png)

- **Machine**: Amstrad CPC 6128  
- **Chip**: AY-3-8912  
- **Role**: First gameplay stage theme (horizontal scrolling)  
- **Key**: Cm  
- **Tempo**: ~112 BPM  
- **Voices**: 3 (bass, arpeggios, lead)

## Description

The Stage 1 theme plays during the initial mission of *Sky Patrol*,  
where the player flies low over an endless ocean under a glowing sunrise.  
The gameplay is fast but not overwhelming, with enemies approaching in  
simple formations. The music reflects a sense of motion and optimism.

## Story / Scene

The squadron proceeds over open waters as distant mountains silhouette  
against the purple dawn. Light enemy drones begin their attack patterns  
while the radar blinks gently on the upper-left corner of the HUD.

## Technical Constraints

- Strict 3-voice AY-3-8912 setup  
- No reverb or stereo effects  
- Arpeggios used to emulate richer harmony  
- Square-wave only (no samples, no modern synths)  
- Loop-friendly structure for continuous gameplay

## Structure / Harmony

- **Progression**: Cm → Ab → Bb → Gm  
- **Lead**: short, catchy pattern designed for tight looping  
- **Bass**: driving eighth-notes, doubled in speed for motion  
- **Arps**: 16th-note sparkle typical of CPC shooters  

## Future Variants

- “Hurry Up!” variant if timer is low  
- Stage 1 night version (CPC palette swap)  
- Hard-mode remix with more noise
